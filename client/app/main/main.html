    <p style="font-size:16px">Ok, so it turns out weddings are a lot more complicated than picking a place, having someone say a few words, exchanging vows, one big kiss, and <strike>drinking</strike> celebrating the night away.  For this reason, we have thrown together this elaborate (and entirely too complicated) site.  -- I mean come on... who really likes javascript this much anyway.  Complications aside, you are here because WE love you.  Somewhere along the lines you have touched us (in some cases one of us or the other... but come on... we are starting this <i>us</i> thing) and we could not let that go unnoticed.  We are hosting 3 <a href="/parties">parties</a> and one <a href="/wedding">wedding</a>, and the kicker is... YOU are invited to all 3.  Now I know what you are thinking:</p>  
    <P class="center-quote"><i>"Ugh, I don't like you that much!"</i></P>
    <p style="text-align: center">or</p>
    <p class="center-quote"><i>"How am I expected to drink THAT much? I mean, I can maybe go toe to toe with Kyle... But Meagan?"</i></p> 
    <p style="text-align: center">or</p>
    <p class="center-quote"><i>"Don't you guys live 2000+ miles away from me?"</i></p>
    <p>That is why we are coming to you! <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zskgaFZpiug8.kzjN-1mqfeSk&usp=sharing">(if you cant figure out which skyline you are closest to... )</a></p>
