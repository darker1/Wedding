        <h4><p><i>Dear family and friends,</i></p></h4>
        <p class="letter-text">You are here because we love you and therefore you have received a piece of mail that directed you to this elaborate
            website (even if this is the first time you are virtually meeting Meagan or Kyle, one of the two of us loves
            you and therefore you are important to both of us). Bear with us now...</p>

            …reads no wedding script EVER!

        <p class="letter-text">
            What is a wedding? Two people in love who, in front of all of the humans who are so important that they couldn’t imagine proclaiming
            something so powerful without having those people there to witness them vowing to spend all of their days and nights loving
            each other more than anything. Easy peasy….until you start thinking about everyone who matters to you and how
            each of those humans would make the most important day of their lives (so far) even more fantastic.
        </p>
        <p class="letter-text">
            Meagan is from the Chicago-land area and her people have spread through the mid-west, the south, the planet... Kyle is from
            all over the South and his people are similarly spread out. And then the two of them left the homeland half a
            decade ago, moved to Los Angeles and built a network of friends and family out here.

            <b><i>Question 1:</i></b> How do two people who have so many important individuals find a way to celebrate the
            best thing that has ever happened to them?
        </p>

        <p class="letter-text">
            <b><i>Answer 1:</i></b> One wedding + three parties. Bingo bango.
        </p>

        <p class="letter-text">
            <b>A)</b> Kyle and Meagan (us) will be exchanging vows in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico on May 7th. Yes, that is wicked
            soon, but we don’t want to wait. Click the “Wedding” tab at the top of your page to find out more about how you
            can take a vaca to Mexico and have fun at a simple beach wedding with a rockin’ party while staying at an all-inclusive
            resort or villa.
        </p>

        <p class="letter-text">
            <b>B)</b> We will also be hosting parties in New Orleans, Chicago, and Los Angeles around the time of the wedding
            so that all of our people can decide where and when they are able to join in on the fun.

            <b><i>Question 2:</i></b> So…my “Save-the-Date” is pretty generic and directed me to this website. Exactly which
            event am I invited to?”
        </p>

        <p class="letter-text">
            <b><i>Answer 2:</i></b> Choose your own adventure! Think of it like an a’la carte menu: you choose any and all
            events you’d like to attend. We know that everyone has family, work, school, and travel constraints
            so we want this to be as fun and easy as possible. Want to come to all four events? Great! Only want to come
            to Los Angeles and New Orleans? Yay! Can only make it to Chicago? Super! RSVP for the event(s) you plan on attending,
            make your arrangements, and we’ll see you there. We’ll help you as much as we can along the way; you’ll find
            ways to find lodging, flights, and descriptions of the shenanigans so you can best plan your journey(s).

            <i>NOTE: No one wakes up one morning and has a wedding fully planned (unless you have an overly-caffeinated, overly-paid woman
            with too much makeup, hair extensions, and a pseudo-degree designated as your “wedding planner”). Therefore,
            this is a living and breathing site. As mentioned earlier, <a href="#navbar">in your upper right hand corner </a>
